title: 'What is GraphQL Code Generator?'
---

I recently came across this and have started to play around with it.

GraphQL Code Generator is a CLI tool that can generate TypeScript typings out of a GraphQL schema. When we develop a GraphQL backend, there would be many instances where we would find ourselves writing the same things which are already described by the GraphQL schema, only in a different format; for example: resolver signatures, MongoDB models, Angular services etc.

Will update this post once I have gotten some more experience with this.
